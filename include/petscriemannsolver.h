/* Flux function in balance law evaluated at a point, specifically in an equation of the form 
   \partial_t u + \div (F(u)) = G(u,x) (a Balance law)
   
   where F : \mathbb{R}^dim \to \mathbb{R}^m 
   dim : dimension of the equation (1,2,3 dimensional in general)
   m   : Size of the system of equations 

   This function is then the specification for F. Currently only using it for dim = 1 problems 
   so there is no assumptions on the format of the output (yet!) in terms of assumed m x dim or dim x m output
   structure for the c array.

    needed/convenient. Will work for now.

    WIP: structure for holding nonlinear (or maybe linear) function calls. This intended to hold the "physics"
    components of the Riemann Solver. Namely flux function point evaluations, point derivatives eigen expansions etc.
    as well as memory alloation for storing all these outputs. This is a simple refactoring to move components associated 
    with the RiemannSolver to this class instead, so it can be reused by other codes, namely DG kernels, this RS, 
    Netowork RiemannSolvers (RSN) 

    This is needed as we have a seperate class for Network Riemann Solvers which also needs this physics data, so it 
    doesn't make sense to associate this with the RS directly. Also makes generating physics for testing 
    and etc much much easier.

/* 
   Similarily I need to experiment with how to compute/store PointFlux derivative information. Honestly this may be 
   better to store in a "Flux" class. This is the same (or similar) problem that PetscDS is tring to solve. For now 
   it will be a patterned function call.

   And again riemann solvers need to be able to compute eigenvalues of the system, for usage in wave-speed estimates. 
   Should design a seperate flux class to store all of these things. Then again, I guess these function callbacks 
   should be exposed anyways, in the case when the physics is not specified in a "PETSc" way. 

   Note: This allows for user specied analytically eigenvalue functions to be specified. In general, when such 
   a function is not available, the riemann solver should default to using the derivative information 
   and slepc (if available, or another eigenvalue solver compiled with petsc) to compute the eigenvalue information. 
   If the derivative is not specified analytically, finite differencing could be used to approximate it as well, 
   however this would be a terrible idea for performance so would only be recommened for debugging. 
   
   This function returns a pointer to an internal eigenvalue work array
