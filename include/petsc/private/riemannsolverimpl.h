    1. Does not work for spatially dependant flux functions 
    2. Might be a good idea to have different versions of evaluate for different inputs? I.e uL, uR as 
       PetscVectors instead of c-style arrays? 
    3. Internally store maxspeeds?
    4. Still need to figure out the right format for higher dimensional results. Tensor formats? 
    5. For now it uses point-wise outputs, but having a time dependant function, or the abilituy 
       to extend the results outside of the point of evualation might be useful 
    6. Also I'm assuming a standard riemann solver, what about the generalized riemann solvers 
    of Toro (related to 5.) and the generalized riemann solvers for networks. These should all be part of the 
    same class right?

  are dispatched based on the dm type and properties of the dm. 
  Note: we have a seperate specific class for RiemannSolvers on DMNetwork, as the Riemann Problem for Networks 
  is distinct from standard riemann problems, and (I think) requires a distinct interface. However they 
  will shared many many features, so we shall see how to make this work. Ideally, shared stuff
  will be seperated into different classes that both NetRS and RS use. 


  The dimension of the problem and etc will be dispatched based on this dm, so a 2-D DMPlex will then solve a 2D 
  Riemann Problem. 

  Note: That while this can definetely be a clone of the DM used in the underlying simulation (and that is the purpose of
  setting this up), it need not be. An inteneded usage is to also have object used just to solve 1D Riemann problems one 
  at a time and nothing else, with the caller managing quadrature and etc when trying to solve higher dimensional problems. 

  I expect that will be the most used option. In order to support that option, you can either feed RiemannSolver a dm directly, 
  probably cloned from your application dm, or you can manually set on up internally by using RiemannSolverSetDim(dim)... , 
  which will internally build a dim dimensional plex dm, to solve that basic RiemannProblem, but will error out of if a 
  dm has already been provided or if one is subsequenlty provided.
