  NOTE: 
    1. Does not work for spatially dependant flux functions 
    2. Might be a good idea to have different versions of evaluate for different inputs? I.e uL, uR as 
       PetscVectors instead of c-style arrays? 
    3. Internally store maxspeeds?
    4. Still need to figure out the right format for higher dimensional results. Tensor formats? 
    5. For now it uses point-wise outputs, but having a time dependant function, or the abilituy 
       to extend the results outside of the point of evualation might be useful 
    6. Also I'm assuming a standard riemann solver, what about the generalized riemann solvers 
    of Toro (related to 5.) and the generalized riemann solvers for networks. These should all be part of the 
    same class right?

   decomposition, instead of directly outputting flux.

   Function specificaiton for computing the maximum wave speed between two points in a riemann problem.
   Default behavior in the convex fluxfun case will be given by 
   maxspeed = max(max(abs(eig(Df(uL)))),max(abs(eig(Df(uR))))), 
   which will always give the correct answer when f is convex. In the non-convex case I need to look up 
   proper default behavior.
