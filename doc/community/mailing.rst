.. important::

   petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov - a private maintenance e-mail without public archives is
   also available. It might be preferable to send issues requiring large attachments here
   (for example uncompressed ``configure.log`, ``make.log`` when encountering installation
   issues).


   Additional notes on sending bug-reports is available at :ref:`documentation <doc_creepycrawly>`

.. note::

   - petsc-announce is an announcement only list (i.e users cannot post on this list).
   - petsc-users and petsc-dev are open; we recommend subscribing and participating
     in the list discussions. However, it is possible to post to the lists without
     subscribing (the first post to the list will be held until list owner can
     enable access)
   - Avoid cross posting to multiple lists. You can reach PETSc developers equally
     on any suitable list.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] This is mostly for PETSc developers, but is by no means a requirement. This mailing
       list is also relevant for those who are interested in the development process of
       PETSc.
